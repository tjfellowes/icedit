# icedit
icedit is a simple tool to modify internal coordinates of a structure.

It currently reads and writes to a SYBYL mol2 file, although nonstandard atom types (eg GAFF atom types) work fine, albeit with complaints from openbabel.
It takes as arguments an input file, output file, 2-4 atom indices (which define the type of internal coordinate, 2=bond, 3=angle, 4=dihedral) and a value for the internal coordinate (in angstroms or degrees).

e.g. $ icedit input.mol2 output.mol2 1 2 11 12 80.0
will set the dihedral defined by atoms 1, 2, 11 and 12 to 80 degrees.

Requires the openbabel python bindings, which you might need to compile yourself. Tested with python2.7 and openbabel3.0.0.
